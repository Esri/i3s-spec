# Filter Authoring Info for building scene layer

The filter authoring info object contains metadata about the authoring process for creating a filter object. This allows the authoring client to save specific, overridable settings.  The next time it is accessed with an authoring client, the selections are remembered. Non-authoring clients can ignore it.
