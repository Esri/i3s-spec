# geometryAttribute

Each geometryAttribute object is an accessor, i.e. a view, into an array buffer. There are two types of geometryAttributes - vertexAttributes and faceAttributes. The vertexAttributes describe valid properties for a single vertex, and faceAttributes describe faces and other structures by providing a set of indices. For example, the <code>faces.position</code> index attribute is used to define which vertex positions make up a face.
