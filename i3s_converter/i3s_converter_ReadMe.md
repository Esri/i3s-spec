# i3s_converter.exe

Command line tool to validate a 1.6 Scene Layer Package (slpk ) or convert a 1.6 slpk to 1.7.  


|      &nbsp;     | Validate | Convert |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| 3DObject        |     X    |    X    |
| Integrated Mesh |     X    |    X    |
| Point           |     X    | &nbsp;  |
| Pointcloud      |     X    | &nbsp;  |

*Note:* 1.7 maintains backwards compatibility with 1.6. The resultant 1.7 slpk will be larger in size than the input slpk. This is due to the creation of Draco-compressed geometries and DXT-compressed textures.  All of these features are important for increased performance. If output slpk size is a limiting factor, the `-x` option can be used to skip writing DXT textures, but this may result in slower drawing performance.  

## Running the executable

#### Open Command Prompt

1. Win+R

2. Enter __cmd__ into pop-up window

#### Run the executable

1. Specify the .exe path

  - Drag and drop the .exe into the command prompt window (absolute path).  
    ![exe_abs_path](readme_images/exe_abs_path.PNG)

  - _cd_ into the directory that contains the .exe (relative path)
    - Use: i3s_converter  
    ![exe_cwd_path](readme_images/exe_cwd_path.PNG)

2. Specify the slpk path

    - Use relative path if executable is in same directory as slpk

    - Otherwise use absolute path

  This is the minumum required to use the converter with an slpk.

## Subcommands

| Subcommand   | Action          |
|--------------|-----------------|
| -b           | Show converter version    |
| -h           | Show usage      |
| -u infile.slpk | Convert slpk to 1.7   |
| -v infile.slpk | Validate slpk |
| -i infile.slpk | Show basic layer info |

## Options

| Option         | Action                  |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| -d dir         | Change output directory. Create it if it doesn't exist|
| -j \[log_name] | Set log name    |
| -e             | Create ETC2 texture \(slow) |
| -o outfile   | 1.7 slpk name   |
| -x             | Don't write DXT textures |

## Examples
In the following example, the .exe and input slpk are in the current working directory.  
It uses:

- -u to convert slpk from 1.6 to 1.7
- -o to the set the name of the new slpk to ExampleSLPK_1_7.slpk
- -j set the log name to ExampleLog
- -d to set the output directory to C:\Users\juan9976\Desktop\ExampleDir

The following example validates a 1.6 slpk. There errors are output to the console.
It uses:
- -v to validate the slpk
- -j to write a json log. (The name of the input slpk is used for the log name)

## Notes

- Only works with __local__ files

- Only the first 10 warnings/errors are output to the command line.

- Any output files are written out relative to the current working directory, unless _-d_ flag is used.

- To avoid having to specify the absolute path to the .exe
  - _cd_ to the directory that contains the .exe
  - add the .exe as a PATH environment variable

- 1.7 slpks and log files will be overwritten when tool is re-run with the same input
