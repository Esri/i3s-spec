### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **center** | number[3] | The center point of the oriented bounding box. For a global scene, i.e. XY coordinate system in WGS1984, center is in longitude of decimal degrees, latitude of decimal degrees, elevation in meters. |
| **halfSize** | number[3] | Half size of the oriented bounding box in spatial reference units (or meters for global scenes). |
| **quaternion** | number[4] | Orientation of the oriented bounding box as a 4-component quaternion. For global scene, quaternion is in Earth-Centric-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian space. ( Z+ : North, Y+ : East, X+: lon=lat=0.0). |
