If the layer defines store.index.lodSelectionMetricType : densityThreshold , then  nodes[i].lodThreshold stores an effectiveArea for the node. This metric may be used as a threshold to split a parent node into its children. This estimation works best when the point cloud scene layer represent a surface and is not volumetric in nature. World space density would be  Dw = node.pointCount / node.effectiveArea  which we call  Ds  once converted to screen space. Client would switch LOD when  Ds  is less/greater than a threshold defined by the client. For example, 0.1 point per pixel square. Note for point cloud scene layer creation: If each point footprint is assumed to be identical (say 0.1x0.1 unit), then the  lodThreshold  may be computed as  number_of_point * point_footprint  for a leaf node and  sum( children[i].effective_area)  for inner nodes."
