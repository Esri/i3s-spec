### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **href** | string | The relative URL to the referenced resource. |
| layerContent | string[] | The list of layer names that indicates which layer features in the bundle belongs to. The client can use this information to selectively download bundles. |
| featureRange | number[] | Only applicable for featureData resources. Provides inclusive indices of the features list in this node that indicate which features of the node are located in this bundle. |
| multiTextureBundle | string | Only applicable for textureData resources. TRUE if the bundle contains multiple textures. If FALSE or not set, clients can interpret the entire bundle as a single image. |
| vertexElements | number[] | Only applicable for geometryData resources. Represents the count of elements in vertexAttributes; multiply by the sum of bytes required for each element as defined in the defaultGeometrySchema. |
| faceElements | number[] | Only applicable for geometryData resources. Represents the count of elements in faceAttributes; multiply by the sum of bytes required for each element as defined in the defaultGeometrySchema. |
