## Profile Version History

I3S profiles evolve independently to provide new capabilities to clients fast. The ESRI I3S scene layer specification is equivalent with the OGC I3S specification. I3S specification version 1.7 is backwards compatible with 1.6. The table below shows the mapping between ESRI and OGC specification.
