Multiple LoD selection metrics can be included. \n\nThese metrics are used by clients to determine the optimal resource access patterns. Each I3S profile definition provides additional details on LoD Selection. \n\nmaxScreenThreshold the default lodSelection metric used for meshpyramids profile, is a per-node value for the maximum pixel size as measured in screen pixels. This value indicates the upper limit for the screen size of the diameter of the node's minimum bounding sphere (MBS). In other words, the content referenced by this node will qualify to be rendered only when the screen size is below the maximum screen threshold value.",
