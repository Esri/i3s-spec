# Building Scene Layer

Building content is often derived from Building Information Modeling (BIM) workflows. BIM is a best-practice process for optimizing design and construction. BIM processes can produce 3D virtual representations of real-world assets that are commonly used for construction, documentation, and evaluation. BIM processes are applied in multiple domains including architecture, buildings, energy, utilities, and transportation. A building scene layer can represent the 3D model content based on BIM structuring disciplines such as architectural or structural, and categories such as windows or walls.

## Building Scene Layer Structure
An I3S building scene layer contains discipline, such as architectural, and category layers, such as walls, as sublayers that represent a building and its assets. Building scene layers can be represented as a scene layer package (*.slpk) or an I3S service. A building scene layer contains the following:

- [3DSceneLayer](layer.bld.md)
- [sublayer](sublayer.bld.md)
- [statistics](stats.bld.md)

*Example of building scene scene layer structure*
