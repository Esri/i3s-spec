# histogram [common profiles]

The bin size may be computed as (max-min)/bin count. Please note that stats.histo.min/max is not equivalent to stats.min/max since values smaller than stats.histo.min and greater than stats.histo.max are counted in the first and last bin respectively. The values stats.min and stats.max may be conservative estimates.

Note on histograms and bins. The x-axis in a histogram is a number line that has been split into number intervals, or bins. The intervals must be consecutive, non-overlapping and usually equal size. For each bin, a bar is drawn where the width of the bar represents the range of the bin, and the height of the bar represents the number of data points that fall into that range.
