# Building Scene Layer

Building content is derived from a Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM is a best-practice process for optimizing design and construction. BIM processes can produce 3D virtual representations of real-world assets that are commonly used for construction, documentation, and evaluation. BIM processes are applied in multiple domains including architecture, buildings, energy, utilities, and transportation. A building scene layer can represent the 3D model aspect of BIM structuring disciplines such as architectural or piping, and its categories like windows or walls.

*Example of a Building Scene Layer*

## Building Scene Layer Structure
The building scene layer contains discipline and category layers as sublayers which represent a building and its assets. Building scene layers can be used to create a scene layer package (*.slpk) or an I3S service. A building scene layer contains the following:

- [Layer description](layer.bld.md)
- [Sublayers](sublayer.bld.md)
- [Statistics](statsummary.bld.md)
