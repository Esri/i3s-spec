This metric can be used by the client to determine whether a representation is of the right quality level for rendering or whether a different representation is needed. Cookers can add as many LodSelection objects as desired but must provide one as soon as the layer's lodType is not null. Of the three min/avg/max values, typically only one or two are used.",
