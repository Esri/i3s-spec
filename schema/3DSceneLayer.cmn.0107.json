The store object describes the exact physical storage of a layer and enables the client to detect when multiple layers are served from the same store. Every scene layer contains 3DSceneLayerInfo. If features based scene layers, such as 3D objects or point scene layers, may include the default symbology. This is as specified in the drawingInfo, which contains styling information for a feature layer.\n\nWhen generating 3D Objects or Integrated Mesh scene layers, the root node never has any geometry. Any node's children represent a higher LoD quality than an ancestor node.  Nodes without geometry at the top of the tree are allowable since the lowest LoD of a feature/geometry is not to shown.",
