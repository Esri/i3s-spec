The Indexed 3D Scene Layer (I3S) format is an open 3D content delivery format used to rapidly stream and distribute large volumes of 3D GIS data to mobile, web and desktop clients.  I3S content can be shared across enterprise systems using both physical and cloud servers.  ArcGIS Scene Layers and [Scene Services](http://server.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/windows/scene-services.htm) use the I3S infrastructure.

# I3S Design Principles

The Esri Indexed 3d Scene layer (I3S) format and the corresponding Scene Layer Package format (*.slpk) are specified to fulfill this set of design principles:  

- **User Experience First**: Provide a positive user experience, including high interactivity and fast display.
- **Scalability**: Support very large scene layers, including scenes with a global extent and many detailed features.
- **Reusability**: Use as a service delivery format, storage format, and exchange format.
- **Level of Detail**: Support multiple detail levels.
- **Distribution**: Allow efficient distribution of very large data sets.
- **User-controllable symbology**: Support efficient rendering of client-side symbology and styling.
- **Extensibility**: Support new layer types, new geometry types, and new platforms.
- **Web Friendliness**: Provide easy to handle data using JSON and current web standards.
- **Compatibility**: Provide a single structure that is compatible across web, mobile, and desktop clients.  Support is also included for cloud and servers.
- **Declarative**: Communicate clearly to minimize the amount of required domain knowledge to support the format.
- **Follow REST/JSON API Best Practices:** Provide navigable links to all resources.

# <a name="introduction-to-3D-scene-layer">Introduction to 3D Scene Layer</a>

A single I3S data set is referred to as a Scene Layer.  It is a container for arbitrarily large amounts of heterogeneously distributed 3D geographic data.  Scene Layers provide clients access to data and allow them to visualize it according to their needs.  The definition of "data" in this case includes geometry, attributes, and texture.

A Scene Layer is characterized by a combination of layer type and profile. The *layer type* describes the kind of geospatial data stored within it. The *layer profile* includes additional details on the specific I3S implementation.

 The supported layer types are:

* [3D Objects](../docs/1.6/3Dobject_ReadMe.md) (e.g. building exteriors, 3D models in various formats)
* [Integrated Mesh](../docs/1.6/IntegratedMesh_ReadMe.md) (e.g. integrated surface including vegetation, buildings and roads)
* [Points](../docs/1.6/Point_ReadMe.md) (e.g. hospitals, schools, trees, street furniture, signs)
* [Point Clouds](../docs/2.0/pcsl_README.md) (e.g. lidar data)
* [Building Scene Layer](../docs/1.6/BSL_ReadMe.md) (e.g. building including its components, such as windows, doors, chairs, etc.)

Layers are described using two properties, type and profile. The type of a layer describes the type of geospatial data stored within it drawing from terms including 3D Objects, Points, Lines, Polygons and Pointclouds. The profile for a layer includes additional detail on the specific I3S implementation for the layer that is exposed to clients. Each layer has a canonical profile, but in certain cases multiple layers that represent semantically different types of information can make use of the same underlying profile. In other cases, the same layer type can support multiple profiles optimized for different use cases. The following table shows the layer types and profiles. For each row the table indicates if the layer type represents features (geographic entities) with identity (as opposed to a geospatial field described by a mesh or cloud of geometry elements) and if the specific profile for the layer supports storage of attributes (either feature attributes or attributes of individual geometry elements, depending on the type of the layer).

| Layer Type                                             | Profile       | Features with Identity | Attributes                                              |

*Examples of 3D Scene Layer Types and Layer Profiles*

### <a name="coordinate-reference-systems"> Coordinate Reference Systems</a>

The I3S specification supports specifying the Coordinate Refence System (CRS) as a Well Known Text, as defined in clause 6.4 in OGC Simple Features [99-036/ISO 19125](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=13227) standard. I3S also supports specifying CRS in the WKT standard [CRS/ISO 19162:2015](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/12-063r5/12-063r5.html), Geographic information – Well-known text representation of coordinate reference systems, which provided an update to the original WKT representation. The two standards are referred to as WKT1 and WKT2 respectively.

In I3S implementation the CRS MAY be represented using either WKT1 or WKT2. While WKT1 has been in use for many years, WKT1 has been superseded by WKT2. Although implementations of OGC standards using WKT2 are not yet widely available the guidance from the OGC/ISO community is to implement WKT2. Important Note: WKT1 does not support explicit definition of axis order.

Therefore, I3S implementers need to note for their implementations if they support WKT1 only or both (as WKT2 requires continued support of WKT1). In addition, please note that not all ArcGIS client applications support WKT2 yet.  

The Coordinate Reference System (CRS) of the Indexed 3D Scene Layer should be selected with the following considerations:

- Minimize the need for re-projection on the client side
- Render in both geographic and projected coordinate reference systems
- Support data with a global extent
- Support local and global data with high positional accuracy

All I3S profiles support writing 3D content in two modes: *global* and *local*. In global mode, only the geographic CRS WGS84, as identified by its EPSG code 4326 is supported for both index and vertex positions. It is represented using longitude, latitude and elevation. In local mode, all other geodetic CRS, including projected coordinate systems, are allowed.

In both modes, node index and position vertex must have the same CRS. In addition, all vertex positions are specified as an *offset* from a node's Minimum Bounding Volume (MBV) center. The MBV could be specified as a Minimum Bounding Sphere (MBS) or as an Oriented Bounding Box (OBB).

As a result, for an I3S layer to be in a *global* mode the following requirements must be met:

The location of all vertex positions and index-related data structures, such as the nodes minimum bounding volume, are specified using the geographic CRS WGS84, where:
   - The only supported CRS in this mode is EPSG code, 4326
   - X and Y Coordinate bounds of the layer and XY components of the vertex position are specified in decimal degrees
   - Elevation (the z component of the vertex position) is specified in meters
   - The Minimum Bounding Volume (MBV) radius unit (for MBS) or halfSize unit (for OBB) is specified in meters

For an I3S layer to be in a *local* mode the following requirements must be met:

All vertex positions are specified using geodetic CRS, identified by an EPSG code. Any CRS with an EPSG code *other* than 4326 will be treated as in a local mode. In addition:
  - All the three components of a vertex position (XYZ) and the Minimum Bounding Volume (MBV) radius (for MBS) or halfSize (for OBB) need to be in the same unit

All I3S layers indicate the coordinate system used by the layer with the spatialReference property in the [3dSceneLayerInfo](../docs/1.6/3DSceneLayer.cmn.md) resource. This property is normative.

The [spatial reference](../docs/1.6/spatialReference.cmn.md) object is common to all i3s profile types.

### <a name="height-models">Height Models</a>

The I3S standard allows either ellipsoidal or gravity-related vertical coordinate systems. This allows I3S to be applied across a diverse range of fields and applications.

At version 1.5, I3S added support for vertical coordinate systems. The Well known Text (WKT) representation of the Coordinate Reference System now includes the vertical coordinate system used by the layer. The [spatial reference](../docs/1.6/spatialReference.cmn.md) object also includes a Well-known ID (WKID) and a Vertical Coordinate System Well-known ID (VcsWKID).  The client application can consume any of these properties to designate the height model.

The heightModelInfo, included in the 3DSceneLayerInfo resource, is used by clients to determine if the layer's height model is orthometric or gravity-related.

For more details, see the [3DSceneLayerInfo-common](../docs/1.6/3DSceneLayer.cmn.md), [3DSceneLayerInfo-point](../docs/1.6/3DSceneLayer.psl.md) and [heightModelInfo](../docs/1.6/heightModelInfo.cmn.md) pages.

## <a name="indexed-scene-layer">Indexed Scene Layers - Organization and Structure</a>

I3S organizes information using a hierarchical, node-based spatial index.  Each node contains features with geometry, textures and attributes.

### <a name="i3s-indexing-model-and-tree-structure">I3S - Indexing Model and Tree Structure</a>

Indexing allows fast access to data blocks. In an Indexed 3D Scene Layer, the spatial extent of the data is split into regions called *nodes*.  Each node has roughly equivalent amounts of data and is organized hierarchically.  The node index allows clients to efficiently determine which data it needs and allows the  server to quickly locate the data requested by any client.  Node creation is capacity driven. For example, the smaller the node capacity, the smaller the spatial extent of the node.

I3S is agnostic with respect to the model used to index objects/features in 3D space. Both regular partitions of space (e.g. Quadtrees and Octrees) as well as density dependent partitioning of space (e.g. R-Trees) are supported. The specific partitioning scheme is hidden from clients who navigate the nodes in the tree exposed as web resources. The partitioning results in a hierarchical subdivision of 3D space into regions represented by nodes, organized in a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) tree.

Each node has an address and nodes may be thought of as equivalent to tiles. A node has an ID that is unique within a layer. I3S supports two types of node ID formats: *treekeys* and integers. Treekeys are a string based identifiers. Integer IDs are based on a fixed linearization of the nodes.

The treekey format is loosely modeled on binary search tree concept. The key value indicates both the level and sibling association of a given node. The key also directly indicates the position of the node in the tree, allowing sorting of all resources on a single dimension.

Treekeys are strings in which levels are separated by dashes.  The root node is at level 1 and should always be indicated by the ID `root`.

![A sample index tree using Treekeys](images/figure-01.png)

*A sample index tree using Treekeys. For example, take the node with treekey "3-1-0".  Since it has 3 numeric elements 3, 1 and 0, it can be concluded that the node is on level 4 (The root node is at level 1). Furthermore, the node "3-1" is its parent node.*

The information for a node is stored in multiple individually accessible resources. The node index document is a lightweight resource that captures Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) tree. key components of the document include bounding volume information,  meta-data used for selection criteria as well as parent-child relationships. The node index document resource allows for tree traversal without the need to access the more voluminous content associated with a node (geometry, texture, attributes).

The decision to render a node by the client application is based on its bounding-volume visibility in the current 3D view. Once the node's bounding volume is determined to be within the current 3D view of the application, then further evaluation is performed by the client app to determine the visual quality of the node. The node’s quality is estimated as a function of current view parameters, node’s bounding volume and LoD selection metric value of the node.

Each node includes the set of information covered by the nodes below it and is part of the path of the leaf nodes below it. Interior nodes may have a reduced representation of the information contained in descendant nodes.

The I3S standard models node information using a set of resources, including, `NodeIndexDocument`, `FeatureData`, `geometry`, `attribures`, and `SharedResource`.  

- [Node Index Document](../docs/1.6/3DSNodeIndexDocument.cmn.md): A lightweight resource that represents a node, its topology, and other sub-resources.
- [Feature Data](../docs/1.6/featureData.cmn.md): A text resource that identifies the features within a node. It can store the geometry and attributes for all the features in the node either by value or by reference.
- [Geometry](../docs/1.6/geometry.cmn.md): The geometries of the features, the identifiers of the owning features, the mapping between individual feature and  geometry segments.
- [Attribute](../docs/1.6/attributeStorageInfo.cmn.md): Describes the structure of the binary attribute data.
- [Texture](../docs/1.6/textureDefinition.cmn.md): Describes how a feature is to be rendered.
- [Shared Resource](../docs/1.6/sharedResource.cmn.md): Models or textures that can be shared among features within the same layer.

An I3S profile uses either a single text-based sub-resource or separate binary sub-resources.  The text-based resources contain all the geometry and attribute information (e.g. Point profile). The separate, binary sub-resources have self-contained geometry and attribute sub-resources (e.g. mesh pyramids). Applications that use the separate binary sub-resources do not need to fetch the feature data in order to interpret them.  

Each node has exactly one `NodeIndexDocument` and one `SharedDescriptors` document. The `FeatureData`, `geometry`, and `attributes` can be bundled to help optimize network transfer and client-side reactivity.  This helps balance index size and feature splitting with optimal network usage.

There are always an equal number of `FeatureData` and `geometry` resources.  Each set contains
the corresponding data elements to render a complete feature.  In order to avoid dependency on the `FeatureData` document, the geometry data is directly available as a binary resource. The geometry data includes all vertex attributes, feature counts, and mesh segmentation.

The figure below shows the node tree of an 3D Object Indexed Scene Layer with a mesh pyramid profile.

- `Nodes` are in green circles.
- `Node identifiers` are in dark blue rectangles above each node.
- `Features` are in orange rectangles within each node.  The numbers in the rectangle are the feature identifiers.
- `Geometry` is in turquoise rectangles. Each geometry resource is an array of geometries. It can also include mesh-segmentation information along with a feature identifier.
- Each node is connected to its children with a green line.
- The attribute and texture resources are omitted from the figure for clarity. They follow a similar storage model to geometry.
- Feature "6" has been generalized away at the lower level of detail node (node "3") and is intentionally no longer represented within its payload.

![Example Nodes in a Mesh Pyramid](images/figure-02.png)

*Example illustrating the composition of an I3S tree for a 3D Object Indexed Scene Layer with a mesh pyramid profile. Orange boxes represent features stored explicitly within the node, the numbers represent feature identifiers. Turquoise boxes represent the geometry instances associated with each node – each geometry instance is an aggregate geometry (a geometry collection) that covers all the features in the node. Blue boxes represent the node ids, the hyphenated numbers represent node ids as string based treekeys.*

### <a name="geometry-model-and-storage">Geometry Model and Storage</a>

All Scene Layer types make use of the same fundamental set of geometry types: points, lines and triangles.

The Array Buffer View controls geometry storage and consumption representation.  For example, the Array Buffer View can require per-vertex layout of components.  This orders the vertex position, normal and texture coordinates to ensure the same pattern across the Scene Layer.

Both 3D Object and Integrated Mesh layer types model geometries as triangle meshes using the mesh-pyramids profile. The mesh-pyramids profile uses the triangles geometry type to store triangle meshes.  The meshes have a reduced level of detail, are segmented by features, and available in the interior nodes.

For more details regarding 3D objects and point scene layer, see [Geometry](../docs/1.6/geometry.cmn.md).

For more details regarding point cloud scene layer, see [defaultGeometryShema](../docs/2.0/defaultGeometrySchema.pcsl.md).

### <a name="textures-structure">Textures</a>

Textures are stored as a binary resource with a node. The texture resource contains the texture images.  I3S supports most commonly used image formats, like JPEG and PNG, and compressed texture formats such as S3TC and ETC2.  Both integrated mesh and 3D object profile support textures. Authoring applications can provide additional texture formats using `textureEncoding` declarations.

For more details, see the [Textures](../docs/1.6/texture.cmn.md) section.

### <a name="attribute-model-and-storage">Attribute Model and Storage</a>

I3S supports two ways to access attribute data.  They can be accessed through:

1. Paired services with RESTful endpoints.
   - Enables direct access to source data.
   - The query uses the unique feature ID key.

2. Fully cached attribute information within the I3S store.
   - Binary storage representation, which provides a significant performance benefit.

Clients can use either method if the attributes are cached. The attribute values are stored as a geometry aligned, per field, key-value pair arrays.  

For more details regarding point cloud scene layer, see [AttributeInfo](../docs/2.0/attributeInfo.pcsl.md).

For more details on all other scene layer types, see [Attribute](../docs/1.6/attributeStorageInfo.cmn.md).

## <a name="bounding-volume-hierarchy">Bounding Volume Hierarchy</a>

Bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is based on minimum bounding sphere (MBS) or oriented bounding box (OBB).
The mesh-pyramids profile supports specifying the bounding volume in either MBS or OBB representation. OBB is the more optimal representation and implementers are encouraged to output node bounding volume in OBB format. Point cloud profile supports OBB representation only.

For more details regarding the two types of bounding volumes see [minimum bounding box](../docs/1.6/mbs.cmn.md) and [oriented bounding box](../docs/1.6/obb.cmn.md) sections.

## <a name="level-of-detail">Level of Detail</a>

Scene Layers include Levels of Detail (LoD) that apply to the whole layer and serve to generalize the layer. They are similar to image pyramids or raster vector tiling schemes. A node in the I3S scene layer tree could be considered the analog of a tile in a raster or vector tiling scheme. Scene Layers support Levels of Detail in a manner that preserves the identity of the individual features that are retained within any level of detail. Levels of Detail can be used to split heavy features, thin or cluster for better visuals, and integrate externally authored multiple LOD files.

Note that the I3S Level of Detail concept is orthogonal to the concept of consolidated storage (batches) for a set of geometries within a level of detail. Batching  of geometries into larger geometry collection assists in optimal rendering. Geometry Array Buffers can be used to provide access to the individual geometries when needed, preserving the feature to geometry element mapping within the consolidated geometries.

### <a name="discrete-level-of-detail">Discrete Level of Detail</a>

Discrete Levels of Detail provide multiple models to display the same object.  A specific detail level is bound to certain levels of the index tree. Leaf nodes typically contain the original feature representation with the most detail.  The closer a node is to the root (in the BVH tree), the lower the level of detail. The detail is reduced by texture down-sampling, feature reduction/generalization, mesh reduction/generalization, clustering or thinning in order to ensure inner nodes have a balanced weight. The number of discrete Levels of Detail for the layer corresponds to the number of levels in the index tree.

By using only information found in the node index document, such as bounding volume and level of detail selection metrics, a client application traversing an I3S tree can readily decide if it needs to:

- Stop traversal to the node's children if the current node bounding volume is not visible.
- Use the data in the node if the quality is appropriate, and then stop traversal to children.
- Continue traversal until nodes with higher quality are found.

I3S supports multiple level of detail selection metrics and switching level of detail models.  Details about the level of detail generation process can be optionally included in the Scene Layer's metadata.

### <a name="multiple-representations">Multiple Representations</a>

I3S Layers can be used to represent input data that already have multiple, semantically authored, levels of detail. The most common method is to represent each  semantically authored input level of detail as its own I3S Layer with visibility thresholds. The thresholds capture the range of distances for which the layer should be used.

A set of I3S Layers that represent a single level of detail can be grouped within the same I3S service. For each layer within the set, the features in the leaf nodes represent the modeled features at the level of detail of the input data. Additional levels of detail can be generated automatically by extending the viewing range of each input level.

Tools can also be developed to load a semantically authored levels of detail input data into a single I3S layer. In this case, the depth of the I3S index tree is fixed to the number of levels of detail present in the input data. Feature identities and geometries in each node are set based upon the input data.

### <a name="switching-models">Switching Models</a>

Node switching lets clients focus on the display of a node as a whole.  A node switch occurs when the content from a node's children is used to replace the content of an existing node.  This can include features, geometry, attributes and textures. Node switching can be helpful when the user needs to see more detailed information.

Each interior node in the I3S tree has a set of features that represent the reduced level of detail.  This includes the details for all features covered by the node.  Due to generalization at lower Levels of Detail, not all features are present in reduced level of detail nodes.

The feature IDs link the reduced level of detail feature and an interior node, as well as the descendant nodes.  Applications can determine the visual quality by using the I3S tree to display all of the features in an internal node or use the features found in its descendants.

### <a name="level-of-detail-generation">Level of Detail Generation</a>

Integrated Mesh layer types typically come with pre-authored Levels of Detail.  If the desired level of detail does not exist, it can be generated.

For example, 3D Object Layers based on the mesh-pyramids profile can create a level of detail pyramid for all features based on generalizing, reducing and fusing the geometries of individual features while preserving feature identity. The same approach can also be used with Integrated Mesh Layers based on the mesh-pyramid profile.  In this case, there are no features, and each node contains a generalized version of the mesh covered by its descendants.

The bounding volume hierarchy tree is built based on the spatial distribution of the features.  The method used to create the levels depends on the Scene Layer type.

*Example Level of Detail generation methods based on Scene Layer type*

### <a name="selection-metrics">Selection Metrics</a>

Selection metrics help clients determine which level of detail to render.  For example, clients need to weigh the options of screen size, resolution, bandwidth, and memory to reach the target quality.  

For more details regarding Integrated Mesh, 3D objects and point scene layer, see the [Level of Detail Selection](../docs/1.6/lodSelection.cmn.md).

## <a name="scene-layer-packages">Scene Layer Packages</a>

Scene Layer Packages (SLPK) allow a complete I3S layer, with all resources, to be transported or exchanged as a single file.  It can be consumed by applications directly.

A Scene Layer Package is

- Always archived using [zip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_(file_format%29) compression
  - STORE is the preferred compression schema since an SLPK is intended for direct consumption by clients, especially if a resource compression is already applied on the individual resources.
  - This compression scheme has to be either STORE or DEFLATE64. DEFLATE is acceptable as a fallback if DEFLATE64 is not available, but will only work with smaller SLPKs.
- Every resource, except textures, can be individually compressed. Compressed textures can have additional GZIP compression applied. Only the GZIP scheme is supported, since DEFLATE is not universally supported by all browsers.

The figure below shows a Scene Layer Package archive with the BASIC folder pattern.  The I3S specification also allows an EXTENDED folder pattern, that uses subtree partitions to avoid problems with very large packages.  The top level includes a <em>nodes</em> folder with  

- A subfolder that contains all node resources
- A *metadata.json* file that describes the content of the SLPK
- A *3dSceneLayer.json.gz* file that defines the Scene Layer

![Structure of an SLPK file](images/figure-15.png)

*Example of an SLPK with BASIC folder layout.*

The *3dNodeIndexDocument.json.gz*, *features/0.json.gz* and *SharedResource.json.gz* correspond to 3dNodeIndexDocument, featureData and SharedResource documents of the Scene Layer, respectively, and are JSON with GZIP compression.

An SLPK with basic folder layout has at the top level a *nodes* subfolder containing all node resources, a *metadata.json* file that describes the content of the SLPK and a *3dSceneLayer.json.gz* file that defines the Scene Layer. In the example above, the nodes subfolder contains, nodes named *root*, *1-4-2-0*, and other nodes not pictured.  All file resources within a particular node (e.g. *1-4-2-0*), can be individually compressed with GZIP (indicated by the file extension *.gz*).  Note, the texture resource is not compressed because it is an image (JPEG *textures/0_0.jpg*).

Resources in subfolders, like *geometries* and *attributes*, are serialized as binary, and correspond to the geometryData and attributeData (e.g. *geometries/0.bin.gz* and *attributes/f_0/bin.gz*)

For the above example, an SLPK file is employed as follows:

1. SLPK as a transfer format
   - Archive Compression Type: DEFLATE64
   - Resource Compression Type: None
2. SLPK as a serving format
   - Archive Compression Type: STORE
   - Resource Compression Type: GZIP

### <a name="metadata">Metadata</a>

Every SLPK archive has a *metadata.json* file. The following entries are required and must be of the specified type.  The default is in **bold**.

| Property                | Details                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| folderPattern           | One of {**BASIC**, EXTENDED}             |
| ArchiveCompressionType  | One of {**STORE**, DEFLATE64, [DEFLATE]} |
| ResourceCompressionType | One of {**GZIP**, NONE}                  |
| I3SVersion              | One of {1.2, 1.3, 1.4, **1.6**}          |
| nodeCount               | Total number of nodes in the SLPK        |

*Metadata properties*

### <a name="key-value-stores">Key Value Stores</a>

In this persistence schema, all Scene Layer resources are stored within either key value based cloud blob stores (e.g. Amazon Simple Storage (S3), Windows Azure Blob Storage) or with more general key value stores. In cloud blob stores, layer resources are stored as either simple objects within containing buckets (S3) or blobs within blob containers (Azure). In all cases, each resource is identified by a unique key.  The default is in **bold**.

*Example SceneService in a key value store environment with textured geometries and attribute data*

## <a name="rest-api-for-attribute-resources">REST API for Attribute Resources</a>

The attributes REST API allows client apps to fetch the attribute records of a field using its _key_ property directly from a scene service layer.  Every scene node (with the exception of `root` node), exposes attribute fields as discrete _attribute_ resources. These resources are accessible through a relative URL to any Node Index Document.

The Attributes REST API syntax:
 URL: **http://&lt;sceneservrice-url&gt;/attributes/&lt;field_key&gt;/&lt;id>**

- *attributes*: the RESTful resource responsible for fetching the binary attribute. Clients will decode the content based on the metadata found in the scene layer _attributeStorageInfo_ array
- *field\_key*: the key value used to request the feature attribute content
- _id_: the bundle ID of the _attribute_ binary resource, corresponding to the geometry bundle id. By default, this value is 0 (same as the geometry bundle id). If a node has more than 1 geometry resource, then the id of the _attribute_ resource will also match the geometry bundle id.

### <a name="usage-pattern-of-the-attributes-REST-API">Usage pattern of the _attributes_ REST API</a>

1. A client should get the attribute field from the metadata by fetching the scene server layers REST resource prior to symbolizing the node base on attribute information.  The layers resource contains the files array, which lists all available attribute fields, types, and the Attribute Storage Info array.  

   - The fields array object contains a collection of objects that describe each attribute, including its name ('name'), datatype ('type') and a user friendly name ('alias'). It includes all fields in the source feature layer of the scene service layer.  
   - The attributeStorageInfo array contains a collection of objects that describes all attribute binary resources. It includes only fields the publisher chose to include as part of the scene cache during publishing time.

   For more details, see the [attribute storage info model](../docs/1.6/attributeStorageInfo.cmn.md).

1. A client application equipped with the list of available fields and the corresponding attribute-value-array metadata, can then fetch the attribute values by using the _key_ as part of the attributes REST request. Furthermore, it is capable of decoding the fetched _attribute_ resource based on the metadata as retrieved in step 1.  

   Note: The geometry buffer contains the _objectIDs_ array as the last section of the geometry layout (layers[id].store.defaultGeometrySchema.featureAttributes). A client application that has a need to access the _ObjectIDs_ array should first check in the geometry buffer before requesting it from the _attributes_ REST resource.

### <a name="attribute-resource-details">Attribute Resource - Details</a>

A numeric attribute resource is a singe, one dimensional array.  A string attribute resource is two, sequential, one dimensional arrays.

The structure of each attribute resource is declared upfront in the scene layer resource through the Attribute Storage Info. The client is reads the Attribute Storage Info metadata to get the header information, the order, and the value types before consuming the binary attribute resource.

Let's take a look at a sample scene service layer and its field types (see the figure below). This layer has 6 fields named 'OID', 'Shape', 'NEAR_FID', 'NEAR_DIST', 'Name' and 'Building_ID'.  

<div>
<img src="images/figure-14.png" title="A typical attribute (table) info of a feature class" alt="A typical attribute (table) info of a feature class. The _fields_ array that’s shown as an example in the figure and the _attributeStorageInfo_ array in the figure is derived from the attribute value of the above feature class.">
<p>Typical attribute info of a feature class.</p>
</div>  

A scene service layer includes only supported attribute field value types of a feature class. As a result, the 'Shape' field in the figure is not included in the attribute cache of a scene layer.

The figure shows how the feature class maps to different attribute resources.

- **OID** (type: `esriFieldTypeOID`) is by default represented as an _UInt32-Array_, with a 1-d array of _UInt32_ value type.
- **NEAR-FID** (type: `esriFieldTypeInteger`) is represented as an _Int32-Array_, with a 1-d array of _Int32_ value type.
- **NEAR_DIST** (type: `esriFieldTypeDouble`) is represented as a _Double-Array_, with a 1-d array of _Float64_ value type.
- **Name** (type: `esriFieldTypeString`) is represented as a _String-Array_. A String-Array supports storage of variable length strings and is stored as two arrays in sequence.  The first fixed length array has the byte counts of each string (null terminated).  The second array stores the actual string values as UTF8 encoded strings. The value type of the first array is _UInt32_ and the value type of the second array is _String_.

The _attributes_ REST API of a scene layer gives access to all scene cache feature attribute data as binary attribute value arrays.  For example, the figure has 5 binary resources, identified by keys *f_0_, f_1_, f_2_, f_3_*  and *f_4*, and are accessible by the respective rest resource URLs (e.g. .../nodes/&lt;nodeID&gt;/attributes/0/f\_0, .../nodes/&lt;nodeID&gt;/attributes/0/f_1, etc.)

Field Data Types Table below lists a feature layer's field data types. The valueTypes column indicates the supported types for attribute based mapping and symbology.

The following types of attribute value arrays are supported :

- _Int32-Array_, _UInt32-Array_, _UInt64-Array_, _Float64-Array_, _Float32-Array_, _String-Array_

<div>

<p>Attribute data types supported by a scene service layer.</p>
</div>

# <a name="json-resources">JSON Resources</a>

### <a name="supported-data-types">Supported Data Types</a>

A value schema ensures that the JSON properties follow a fixed pattern and support the following data types:

- **String**: utf8 string
- **Float**: float64
- **Integer**: int32
- **UUID**: A hexadecimal universally unique identifier
- **Date**: An ISO 8601 timestamp YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD
- **URL**: Both relative and absolute
- **Pointer**: Any reference to an object in a JSON document, consisting of a URL and a document path
- **NodeID**: A treekey string that is zero-based (first child is "0", root node is "root")

### <a name="pointers">Pointers</a>

Pointers are used to reference specific properties in another document.  They consist of two elements:

1. **In-document reference** (required): References the current property. Absolute references should be used for upstream paths, and relative references should be used for downstream paths.   
2. **URL** (optional): A prefix URL to link to a different document. Use square brackets.

For example, a pointer from FeatureData to `3DSceneLayer.name` using a relative URL and an absolute reference would be written as: `[../../]/name`

### <a name="sceneServiceInfo">SceneServiceInfo</a>

The SceneServiceInfo is a JSON file that describes the capability and data sets offered by an instance of a Scene Service. This file is automatically generated by the Scene Server for each service instance and is not part of a Scene Layer Package (SLPK) file.

### <a name="class-SceneServiceInfo">Class SceneServiceInfo</a>

The Class SceneServiceInfo describes an active SceneService instance.  There is exactly one SceneServiceInfo object in a document.

For service examples, see [scene service](../service/SceneService.md).

### <a name="class-3dSceneLayerInfo">Class 3dSceneLayerInfo</a>

The Class 3dSceneLayerInfo describes the properties of a single layer in a store.  It includes the default symbology, or the stylization information, for a layer.  The symbology is further described in the sub Class [Class DrawingInfo](../docs/1.6/drawingInfo.cmn.md)

For more details regarding Integrated Mesh, 3D objects, see [3D Scene Layer Info](../docs/1.6/3DSceneLayer.cmn.md).

For more details regarding point, see [3D Scene Layer Info](../docs/1.6/3DSceneLayer.psl.md).

For more details regarding point cloud, see [Layer description](../docs/2.0/layer.pcsl.md).

### <a name="class-store">Class Store</a>

The Class Store object describes the physical storage of a layer.  This enables the client to detect when multiple layers are served from the same store. Including multiple layers in a single store allows them to share resources.  When the resources are shared, layers with different attribute schemas or symbology, but the same content type, can be served efficiently.

For more details regarding Integrated Mesh, 3D objects, see the [store](../docs/1.6/store.cmn.md).  
For more details regarding point scene layer, see the [store point scene layer](../docs/1.6/store.psl.md).  
For more details regarding point cloud scene layer, see the [store point cloud scene layer](../docs/2.0/store.pcsl.md).

### <a name="class-geometry-schema">Class Geometry Schema</a>

The defaultGeometry schema is used in stores where all ArrayBufferView geometry declarations use the same pattern for face and vertex elements. It reduces redundancies of ArrayBufferView geometry declarations in a store, and reuses the GeometryAttribute type from FeatureData. Only valueType and valuesPerElement are required.

For more details regarding Integrated Mesh, 3D objects and point scene layer, see the [default geometry schema](../docs/1.6/defaultGeometrySchema.cmn.md).

For more details regarding point scene layer, see the [default geometry schema point cloud scene layer](../docs/2.0/defaultGeometrySchema.pcsl.md).

### <a name="class-headerAttribute">Class HeaderAttribute</a>

Headers to Geometry resources must be uniform across a cache and may only contain fixed-width, single element fields. The HeaderDefinition provides the name of each field and the header valueType.

For more details regarding 3D objects and point scene layer, see [header attribute](../docs/1.6/headerAttribute.cmn.md).

### <a name="class-field">Class Field</a>

The Field class is used to provide schema information for a 3dSceneLayer.

For more details regarding Integrated Mesh, 3D objects and point scene layer, see the [class field](../docs/1.6/field.cmn.md).

For more details regarding point cloud scene layer, see the [class field](../docs/2.0/field.cmn.md).

### <a name="class-indexscheme">Class IndexScheme</a>

The IndexScheme class describes the computational and structural properties of the index used within an I3S store.

Point clouds have a different index scheme. For more details, see [point cloud index scheme](../docs/2.0/index.pcsl.md).

### <a name="class-drawinginfo">Class DrawingInfo</a>

DrawingInfo and the associated classes contain the default symbology (drawing information) of an Indexed 3D Scene Layer.

When the DrawingInfo object is present in the 3dSceneLayerInfo Class, a client can symbolize an I3S layer using the Renderer information.  The DrawingInfo can alternatively be captured in the Scene Layer as part of the binary I3S representation.  This helps support clients that may not be able to override the symbology in a layer.  In this case, the DrawingInfo is described in the CachedDrawingInfo class.

For more details regarding 3D objects and point scene layer, see [drawing info](../docs/1.6/drawingInfo.cmn.md).

For more details regarding point cloud scene, see [drawing info point cloud scene layer](../docs/2.0/drawingInfo.pcsl.md).

### <a name="class-statisticsInfo">Class StatisticsInfo</a>

Statistical information help clients to define symbology, definition queries or other functionality which is depending on statistical information.

For more details regarding 3D objects and point scene layer, see [statisticsInfo](../docs/1.6/statisticsInfo.cmn.md)

For more details regarding point cloud scene layers, see [statistics](../docs/2.0/statistics.pcsl.md).

### <a name="class-domains">Class Domains</a>

Attribute domains are rules that describe the legal values of a field type, providing a method for enforcing data integrity. Attribute domains are used to constrain the values allowed in any particular attribute for a table or feature class. If the features in a feature class or non-spatial objects in a table have been grouped into subtypes, different attribute domains can be assigned to each of the subtypes. A domain is a declaration of acceptable attribute values. Whenever a domain is associated with an attribute field, only the values within that domain are valid for the field. In other words, the field will not accept a value that is not in that domain. Using domains helps ensure data integrity by limiting the choice of values for a particular field.

For more details regarding 3D objects scene layer and point scene layer, see [domains](../docs/1.6/domain.cmn.md).

### <a name="class-material">Class Material</a>

For more details Integrated Mesh and 3D object scene layer, see [cached drawing info](../docs/1.6/cachedDrawingInfo.cmn.md).

### <a name="3dNodeIndexDocument"></a>3dNodeIndexDocument

The 3dNodeIndexDocument file describes a single index node within a store.  It includes links to other nodes (children, siblings, and parent), feature data, geometry data, texture data, and other metadata.

Depending on the geometry and level of detail, a node document can be tuned to be light-weight or heavy-weight.  Clients decide which data to retrieve.  A simple data visualization can be created using centroids with the details from the node, its parent, its children, and neighbors to help the client understand the overall distribution of the data.

For more details Integrated Mesh, 3D objects and point scene layer, see [3D Node Index Document](../docs/1.6/3DSNodeIndexDocument.cmn.md).

### <a name="class-level-of-detail-selection"></a> Class Level of Detail Selection

A level of detail selection (lodSelection) object provides information about a metrics determined during
the cooking process.  Clients use these metrics to determine representation quality.

Cookers can add as many lodSelection objects as desired but must provide at least one so that the level of detail type (lodType) is not null. Typically, minimum, average, or maximum value is used.

For more details Integrated mesh, 3D objects and point scene layer, see [level of detail selection](../docs/1.6/lodSelection.cmn.md).

### <a name="featureData"></a>FeatureData

The FeatureData JSON files contain geographical features with a set of attributes, accessors to geometry attributes, and other references to styling or materials.  

Point Clouds do not have feature data.

For details on all other layer types, see [feature data](../docs/1.6/featureData.cmn.md).

### <a name="class-feature"></a> Class Feature

A Feature is a single object within a GIS data set.  It usually represents a real world feature.

For more details 3D objects and point scene layer, see [feature data](../docs/1.6/featureData.cmn.md).

## <a name="shared-resources"></a>Shared Resources

Shared Resources are models or textures stored as a JSON file that can be shared among features within the same layer.  The Shared Resources are stored in the subtree of the current node. This approach ensures an optimal distribution of shared resources across nodes, while maintaining the node-based updating process.  

Shared resources include the [material definition](../docs/1.6/materialDefinition.cmn.md) and [texture defintion](../docs/1.6/textureDefinition.cmn.md) for the resource regarding Integrated mesh and 3D objects scene layer.

# <a name="textures"></a> Textures

The Textures file is a binary resource that contains images to be used as textures for the features in the store.  A single Texture.bin file contains 1 to n textures for a single specific texture level of detail. It can contain a single texture atlas or multiple individual textures.  The bundling is determined by the authoring application so that specific aspects of the materials and textures used can be taken into account (e.g. tiling).

## <a name="texture-recommendations-and-requirements"></a> Texture Recommendations and Requirements

The number and volume of textures tends to be the limiting display factor, especially for web and mobile clients.  Here are are few guidelines to get the most out of texture resources.

**Image Formats**

I3S supports multiple texture formats.  The format used depends on the use case. For example, a client might choose to consume JPEG in low bandwidth conditions since they are efficient to transmit and widely used. However, clients constrained for memory or computing resources might choose to directly consume compressed textures such for scalability and performance.

I3S supports most commonly used image formats such as JPEG/PNG, as well as rendering optimized compressed texture formats such as S3TC. The authoring application needs to provide the appropriate texture encoding declaration using MIME types such as “image/jpeg” (for JPEG) and “image/vnd-ms.dds” (for S3TC).

**Texture Sets**

Multiple textures can be combined into a single texture using array buffer views.  Large texture atlases (e.g. 2048 x 2048 px) with one texture per bundle are recommended.

**Atlas Usage and Regions**

Individual textures should be aggregated into texture atlases.  Each individual texture becomes a subtexture.  As with all texture resources, the atlas has to be 2^n sized on both dimensions, where n ranges [3,12].  Width and height do not need to be equal.  Subtextures also need to be 2^n sized with n in range [3,12].  Subtextures with other dimensions can cause border artifacts when filtering or MIP-mapping.  A subtexture can be padded to the nearest lower 2^n size by interpolating or scaling pixels.

Subtexture pixels are identified by the subimageRegion attribute: [umin, vmin, umax, vmax].  Region information is passed to the shader using a separate vertex attribute, which converts a UV vertex coordinate to a UVR coordinate.  R encodes the [umin, vmin, umax, vmax] attribute values into 4 UInt16 values.

**Texture coordinates**

Client capabilities for handling complex UV cases vary widely, so texture coordinates are used. Texture coordinates do not take atlas regions into account directly. They range from 0 to 1 in U and V, except when using the "repeat" wrapping mode.  In repeat mode, U and V  range from 0 to n, where n is the number of repeats. The client is expected to use the subimage region values and the texture coordinates to best handle repeating textures in atlases.

### <a name="geometry"></a> Geometry

The binary geometry attribute file follows the <a href="http://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/">Khronos Typed Array
specification</a> in the Editor's Draft version of 10<sup>th</sup> April 2013.

Citing the overview of that spec:

> This specification defines an ArrayBuffer type, representing a generic fixed-length binary buffer. It is not possible to manipulate the contents of an ArrayBuffer directly. Instead, a group of types are used to create views of the ArrayBuffer. For example, to access the buffer as an array of 32-bit signed integers, an Int32Array would be created that refers to the ArrayBuffer.  
>Multiple typed array views can refer to the same ArrayBuffer, of different types, lengths, and offsets. This allows for complex data structures to be built up in the ArrayBuffer. For example:

```
// create an 8-byte ArrayBuffer
var b = new ArrayBuffer(8);
// create a view v1 referring to b, of type Int32, starting at
// the default byte index (0) and extending until the end of the buffer
var v1 = new Int32Array(b);

// create a view v2 referring to b, of type Uint8, starting at
// byte index 2 and extending until the end of the buffer
var v2 = new Uint8Array(b, 2);

// create a view v3 referring to b, of type Int16, starting at
// byte index 2 and having a length of 2
var v3 = new Int16Array(b, 2, 2);
```

>This defines an 8-byte buffer b, and three views of that buffer, v1, v2, and v3. Each of the views refers to the same buffer -- so v1[0] refers to bytes 0..3 as a signed 32-bit integer, v2[0]
refers to byte 2 as a unsigned 8-bit integer, and v3[0] refers to bytes 2..3 as a signed 16-bit integer. Any modification to one view is immediately visible in the other: for example, after v2[0] = 0xff; v2[1] = 0xff; then v3[0] == -1 (where -1 is represented as 0xffff).

The expected triangle/face winding order in all geometry resources is counterclockwise.

If normal vectors are present in a geometry, they need to be calculated based on uniform axis units. They are always given as if x, y and z axes all had metric units, as a unit vector. This means that if WGS84 is used as a horizontal Coordinate Reference System, the normal calculation cannot directly use the face's WGS84 coordinates, but needs to convert them to a local Cartesian Coordinate Reference System first.

### <a name="attribute-data"></a> Attribute Data

Attribute data is stored within I3S layers as part of the Scene Service cache along with geometry, texture, and material resources in an optimized, render friendly format.

Attribute data is the primary input source for scene services. The tabular information is stored as an attribute of a feature class.

Attribute data for all features in a node are stored and available as discrete, per field resource called *attribute*. The number of attribute resources corresponds to the number of fields in the scene cache.  

Attributes values are stored in the attribute resource in the same order as feature geometries are in the geometry resource. This allows clients to render each node efficiently through direct array access instead of object-id based attribute lookups.  

When access to the object-id is needed, the _attribute_ resource represents the object-id field stores the object-id values of each feature within the node.  This facilitates object-id based access. Clients can also build an object-id to array-index dictionary for cases where large numbers of object-id based attribute or geometry look ups within a node are needed.

When the same feature is included in more than one node at different Levels of Detail, the corresponding attributes for the feature are included as attribute resources in each node. This redundancy in attribute storage allows each node to be rendered independently of any other node.  

Metadata on each _attribute_ resource is made available to clients via the scene service layer. When attributes are present within the scene cache, the resourcePattern array in the layers store will include a value called attributes.  The attributes value indicates that attributes are a required resource, utilized for attribute driven symbolization and rendering. In addition to the resourcePattern, additional metadata in the fields array and attributeStorageInfo array further describe each attribute resource.  

These metadata allow clients to initialize and allocate any required client side resources prior to accessing any attributes of interest.  

<div>
<img src="images/figure-11.png" title="An example of the fields array." alt="An example of the fields array (layers[id].fields[]) resource of a scene service layer illustrating different supported types of feature attribute fields. The fields array describes an attribute field with respect to its key, name, type and alias.">
<p>An example of the fields array (layers[id].fields[id]) resource of a scene service layer illustrating different supported types of feature attribute fields. The fields array describes an attribute field with respect to its name, type and alias.</p>
</div>
Clients can use the key property (layers[id].attributeStorageInfo[].key) of the attributeStorageInfo to uniquely identify and request the attribute resource through a RESTful API, called attributes. Clients use the attributeStorageInfo metadata to decode the retrieved attribute binary content.

The attribute resource header contains:

- A header section of 4 bytes with the count of features. The count value is present in all attribute resources.  For attributes with string resources, header has an additional 4 bytes indicating the total byte count of the string attribute values.
- For all numerical field types, the header section is followed by the attribute values array record. The attribute values must always begin at an offset that is divisible by the byte length of a single value. If the header does not end at such an offset, the necessary amount of padding is inserted between the header and the attribute values.
- For string field types, the header section is followed by a fixed length array whose values are the byte counts of each string data, inclusive of the null termination character. This array is then followed by an array of actual string data. The strings are stored null terminated.

A client application will be able to find the URI of any attribute resource through its reference from the attributeData array of the Node Index Document (similar access patterns exist for resources such as 'features', 'geometries', etc.). See the figure below:

### <a name="accessing-the-legend-of-a-3d-object-layer"></a> Accessing the legend of a 3D Object Layer

Legends are essential for proper display and complete communication of represented information of a 3D Object Layer.

Clients are responsible for building legend information from the *drawingInfo* resource for the scene layer.
Scene layers and scene services behave identically to feature layers and feature services.

# <a name="i3s-flexibility"></a> I3S Flexibility

I3S supports many different implementations.  The implementation decisions can be made based on the type of 3D data and the layer profile. Here are a few implementation options:

**The Minimum Bounding Volume (MBV)**

- Minimum Bounding Sphere (MBS)
- Oriented Bounding Box (OBB)

**Node Structure**

- Expanded: Supports clients that want to get more complete metadata about a node's position in the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) and its immediate neighborhood.  Each node index provides pointers to its parent, children, and sibling.  Used by mesh-pyramids and points profiles.
- Fixed-size: Supports paged access. Minimal structural elements: only the bounding volume, first child reference, child count, level of detail selection data, etc.  Used by the Point Cloud profile.

**Embedded Geometry**

- Included as text (JSON) with other metadata within a feature data resource.  Supports profiles where run-length encoding of feature IDs along the vertex data is suboptimal.  Typed array buffer and fixed format binary buffers are supported.  Used by the points profile.

**Binary Geometry**

- For Voluminous, ready to render geometries and cached attributes.  Typed array buffer and fixed format binary buffers are supported.  Used by mesh pyramids (array buffer views using the Khronos Types Array specification) and Point Clouds (to support domain specific data compression).

**Level of Detail Selection**

Level of detail switch based on:

- maxScreenThreshold: The screen size of the node's minimum bounding volume.  Used by mesh pyramids
- screenSpaceRelative: The scale of the node's minimum bounding volume.  used by the points profile.
- distanceRangeFromDefaultCamera: Normalized distance of the node's minimum bounding volume from the camera.  Used by the points profile.
- effectiveDensity: Estimation of the point density covered by the node.  Used by Point Clouds.

### <a name="i3s-defining-characteristics"></a> I3S Defining Characteristics

- Attributes may be included on individual entities, on individual point cloud points, or on partial segments of meshes
- Attribute based stylization may be modified by client software
- Multiple, alternative textures may be provided to optimize for per-platform performance and display
- Texture and attribute data be created as JSON for index and metadata, and binary for large geometries
- A Scene Layer Package format for distribution, or direct use, of the scene layer as a single file (see SLPK section)
- Direct access is enabled through optional paired services that expose query-able and updatable RESTful endpoints
- Explicit control over bounding index shape and per-node switching allows for optimized display and query
- Bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) is based on minimum bounding sphere (MBS) or oriented bounding box (OBB)
- Scene Layers may be created in Cartesian 3D or in global 3D world coordinate systems

### <a name="persistence"></a> Persistence

I3S Scene Layers can be delivered to web, mobile and desktop clients using a number of patterns. Most users will interact with Scene Layers using applications with cloud or server based information.  In these cases, the scene layer cache is on the server and is provided to clients through a RESTful interface. These [web addressable]([scene service](../service/SceneService.md) resources provide access to the scene layer, nodes, and associated resources.  

Alternatively, a scene layer can be delivered as a Scene Layer Package.  This is a single file that includes the complete node tree and all necessary resources in an archive.  It allows direct access to individual nodes and their resources.  


All storage methods store the Indexed 3D Scene Layers in a simple key-value structure, where the key is the access URL and the value is resource (e.g. JSON document).
