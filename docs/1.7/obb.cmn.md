### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **center** | number[3] | The center point of the oriented bounding box. For a global scene, such as the XY coordinate system in WGS1984, the center is specified in latitude/longitude in decimal degrees, elevation (Z) in meters. |
| **halfSize** | number[3] | Half size of the oriented bounding box in units of the CRS. For a global scene, such as the XY coordinate system in WGS1984, the center is specified in latitude/longitude in decimal degrees, elevation (Z) in meters. |
| **quaternion** | number[4] | Orientation of the oriented bounding box as a 4-component quaternion. For a global scene, the quaternion is in an Earth-Centric-Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Cartesian space. ( Z+ : North, Y+ : East, X+: lon=lat=0.0). Note: A quaternion is a four-element vector that can be used to encode any rotation in a 3D coordinate system. The quaternion components are in the order x, y, z, w.  |
