A client needs information to determine whether a node's contents are \"good enough\" to render in the current 3D view under constraints such as resolution, screen size, bandwidth and available memory and target minimum quality goals. Multiple LoD selection metrics can be included. \n\nThese metrics are used by clients to determine the optimal resource access patterns. Each I3S profile definition provides additional details on LoD Selection.",

Tobler_](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1f59/8266e387cf367702d16acf5a4e02cc72cb99.pdf) for an efficient algorithm). If a **look-angle independent** LOD switching is desired, viewers may use the area of minimum bounding-sphere (MBS) of the node if available or the MBS of the OBB otherwise.
