# Filter Authoring Info for Filter Blocks

The filter authoring info object contains metadata about the authoring process for creating a filter block object. This allows the authoring client to save specific, overridable settings.  The next time it is accessed via an authoring client, their selections are remembered. Non-authoring clients can ignore it.
