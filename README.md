Scene Layers: Service and Package Standard
===============================================

![App](./sceneLayers.jpg "Multiple Scene Layers in Web Scene Viewer")[http://www.arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com)

This repository hosts the standard for Scene Layers which are containers for arbitrarily large amounts of geographic data. The delivery format and persistence model for Scene Layers, referred to as Indexed 3d Scene Layer (I3S) and Scene Layer Package (SLPK) respectively, are specified in detail. Both formats are encoded using JSON and binary ArrayBuffers.

I3S originated from investigations into technologies for rapidly streaming and distributing large volumes of 3D content across enterprise systems that may consist of server components, cloud hosted components, and a variety of client software from desktop to web and mobile applications.  

A single I3S data set, referred to as a Scene Layer, is a container for arbitrarily large amounts of heterogeneously distributed 3D geographic data. A Scene Layer is characterized by a combination of layer type and profile to fully describe the behavior of the layer and the manner in which it is realized within the specification.

The I3S format is declarative and extendable and can be used to represent different types of 3D data.
The following layer types have been specified and the standard validated via implementation and production deployments:
- 3D Objects (e.g. Building Exteriors, from GIS Data as well as 3D models in various formats)
- Integrated Meshes (e.g. eg an integrated surface representing the skin of the earth, from satellite, aerial or drone imagery via dense matching photogrammetric software)
- Point Features (e.g. Hospitals or Schools, trees, street furniture, signs, from GIS Data)

The following layer types are planned for future inclusion:

- Line Features (e.g. from GIS Data)
- Polygon Features (e.g. from GIS Data)
- Pointclouds (e.g. from LiDAR)

The specification of the [Indexed 3d Scene Layer (I3S)](./format/Indexed%203d%20Scene%20Layer%20Format%20Specification.md) and [Scene Layer Package (\*.slpk)](./format/Indexed%203d%20Scene%20Layer%20Format%20Specification.md), as well as the specification for accessing I3S resources as [Scene Service REST](./service/SceneService.md) endpoints, are described in this standard as open formats.


## Designed for Web, Mobile and Cloud  

I3S is designed from the ground up to be cloud, web and mobile friendly. It is based on JSON, REST and modern web standards and is easy to handle, efficiently parse and render by Web and Mobile Clients. I3S is designed to stream large 3d datasets and is designed for performance and scalability.

## Designed for 3D
I3S is intrinsically designed to support 3D geospatial content and supports the requisite coordinate systems and height models in conjunction with a rich set of layer types.

## Open Standard

For the purpose of encouraging community adoption and feedback, I3S is an open standard. By being an open standard, we further hope to ensure that adopting organizations have flexibility in accessing and visualizing their 3D data. The standard is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License. Implementers can use the standard in services, clients or processing tools without restrictions. Consult the [License](### License for Indexed 3D Scene Format and REST Endpoint Specification) section below for more information.

## Where can I use...?

There are few applications that can create and consume I3S content. The tables below list some of those applications. This is an evolving list and will be updated frequently. If an application that's either consuming or generating I3S content is missing, please let us know so we can add it to the list.

The list of supported scene layer types in the ArcGIS platform is growing at every release. For example, support for <em>PointCloud</em> scene layer is currently in active development.
