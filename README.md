Scene Layers: Service and Package Specification
===============================================

[![App](./teaser.jpg "Multiple Scene Services in a Web Viewer")] (http://www.arcgis.com/)

This repository hosts the specification for the ArcGIS Scene Service, including the Indexed 3D Scene delivery format and the Scene Layer Package definition (both encoded using JSON and binary ArrayBuffers). 

A Scene Layer is a container for arbitrarily large amounts of 3D geographic data. The format is a declarative, extendable design to encode different types of 3D data such as:

- 3D Objects (e.g. from Esri Multipatch)
- Integrated Meshes (e.g. from dense matching photogrammetric software)
- Point Features (e.g. from GIS Data)
- Line Features (e.g. from GIS Data)
- Polygon Features (e.g. from GIS Data)
- Pointclouds (e.g. from LiDAR)
- 3D Multirepresentation Objects (e.g. from CityGML files with multiple Levels of Detail)
- Analytics (e.g. from Sensor Data or Simulations)
- ...

## Can I Use...?

For the first release in ArcGIS 10.3.1, we support Scene Layers of the 3D Objects and Integrated Mesh types. All other layer types are in development. Access to these experimental specifications has to be requested separately.

This table explains which implementations of the specification exist and what they support.

Software / Layers     | 3D Objects | Integrated Mesh | ...
--------------------- | ---------- | --------------- | -----------
ArcGIS Server         | 10.3.1     | 10.3.1          | Planned for 10.4.0        
ArcGIS Pro            | 1.1        | 1.1             | Planned for 1.2           
ArcGIS Scene Viewer   | 3.7/10.3.1 | 3.7/10.3.1      | Planned for 3.9/10.4.0 

## Structure

The specification explains how different types of Scene Layers are encoded using profiles. A profile is a common technique often used e.g. in JSON to encode format subsets. Each layer type maps to one profile.

- [Indexed 3d Scene Format](./format/Indexed%203d%20Scene%20Format%20Specification.md) – Specification for the Indexed 3D Scene Format and Scene Layer Package
- [Specification for the REST endpoint](./service/SceneService.md) of the Scene Service with resources and operations
- Example JSON resources and validation rule files for each layer type

We are also building a Validation Toolkit to support developers that is available upon request.
