Scene Layers: Service and Package Specification
===============================================

[![App](./teaser.jpg "Multiple Scene Services in a Web Viewer")] (http://www.arcgis.com/)

This repository hosts the specification for the ArcGIS Scene Service, including the Indexed 3D Scene delivery format and the Scene Layer Package definition. These are the core resources:

-	[Indexed 3d Scene Format](./format/Indexed%203d%20Scene%20Format%20Specification.md) – Specification for the Indexed 3D Scene Format and Scene Layer Package
-	[Specification for the REST endpoint](./service/SceneService.md) of the Scene Service with resources and operations
-	A set of example JSON resources for each profile
-   Validator rule files for each profile

The structure of this specification is as follows:
- Format: Full logical format specification, including  physical format specification for Scene Packages (*.spk)
- Profiles: Subsets the full format specification for different data structures: 
    - Features (Meshes, Points, Lines, Polygons)
	- Meshpyramids 
    - Analytics 
    - Pointclouds
- Service: Contains the REST API specification for the Scene Service.

We are also building a Validation Toolkit to support developers.
