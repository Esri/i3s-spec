| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **id** | number | Unique ID of the geometry in this store. |
| type | string | The type denotes whether the following geometry is defined by using array buffer views (ArrayBufferView), as an internal reference (GeometryReference), as a reference to a shared Resource (SharedResourceReference) or embedded (Embedded). |
| transformation | number[16] | 3D (4x4) transformation matrix expressed as a linear array of 16 values. |
| params | [geometryParams](geometryParams.cmn.md) | The parameters for a geometry, as an Embedded GeometryParams object, an ArrayBufferView, a GeometryReference object, or a SharedResourceReference object. |
