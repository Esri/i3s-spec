Scene Layers: Service and Package Standard
===============================================

![Multiple scene layers in web scene viewer](./sceneLayers.jpg )

This repository hosts the specification for scene layers. Scene layers are containers for large amounts of geographic data. The delivery format and persistence model, referred to as indexed 3D scene layer (I3S) and scene layer package (.slpk) respectively, are specified in detail. Both formats are encoded using JSON and binary ArrayBuffers.

The format I3S originated from investigation into technology for rapidly streaming and distributing large volumes of 3D content across enterprise systems.  These systems can include server components, cloud hosted components, and a variety of client software from desktop to web to mobile applications.  

A single I3S data set, referred to as a scene layer, is a container for arbitrarily large amounts of heterogeneously distributed 3D geographic data. A scene layer is characterized by a combination of layer type and profile to fully describe the behavior of the layer and the manner in which it is realized within the specification.

The I3S format is declarative and extendable, and can be used to represent different types of 3D data.
The following layer types have been specified and the standard validated via implementation and production deployments:

- [3D Objects](docs/1.7/3Dobject_ReadMe.md) (e.g. building exteriors, from GIS data as well as 3D models in various formats)
- [Integrated Mesh](docs/1.7/IntegratedMesh_ReadMe.md) (e.g. an integrated surface representing the skin of the earth, gathered through satellite, aerial, or drone imagery via dense matching photogrammetric software)
- [Point](docs/1.6/Point_ReadMe.md) (e.g. hospitals, schools, trees, street furniture, signs, from GIS data)
- [Point Cloud](docs/2.0/pcsl_ReadMe.md) (e.g. large point data from LiDAR)
- [Building Scene Layer](docs/1.6/BSL_ReadMe.md) (e.g. comprehensive building model including building components)


The specification of the [indexed 3D scene layer (I3S)](format/Indexed%203d%20Scene%20Layer%20Format%20Specification.md) and [scene layer package (\*.slpk)](format/Indexed%203d%20Scene%20Layer%20Format%20Specification.md#scene-layer-packages), as well as the specification for accessing I3S resources as scene service REST endpoints, are described in this standard as open formats.  The REST endpoint implementations are described in the ReadMe for each profile. 


## Designed for Web, Mobile and Cloud  

The goal is to be able to stream large 3D datasets with high performance and scalability. The I3S format is designed from the ground up to be cloud, web and mobile friendly. It is based on JSON, REST and modern web standards, making it easy to handle, parse, and render by Web and Mobile Clients.

## Designed for 3D
The I3S format is intrinsically designed to support 3D geospatial content.  The requisite coordinate systems and height models are used in conjunction with a rich set of layer types.

## Open Standard

For the purpose of encouraging community adoption and feedback, the I3S format is an open standard. By being an open standard, we further hope to ensure that adopting organizations have flexibility in accessing and visualizing their 3D data. The standard is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License. Implementers can use the standard in services, clients or processing tools without restrictions. Consult the [license](#license-for-indexed-3d-scene-format-and-rest-endpoint-specification) section below for more information.

## An OGC Community Standard

On August 8 2017, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) approved I3S as a community Standard which was released to the public as [OGC Indexed 3d Scene Layer (I3S) and Scene Layer Package Format Specification](https://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/i3s) version 1.0.

The open community GitHub specification hosted in this repository is the sole source of content to the OGC I3S Community Standard. The I3S community specification evolves primarily driven by advancements in technology as well as community needs. The OGC process allows for updating and synchronizing the Community Standard with this open community GitHub version at regular intervals to achieve equivalency.

OGC is in the process of updating the I3S Community Standard to Version 1.1 to pick up updates from this repository. To facilitate this process, as well as provide new capabilities fast to the community without impacting existing scene layer types and profiles, each I3S profile evolves and is versioned independently.

The table below shows how the OGC I3S Community Standard relates to the I3S specification hosted here.

| **I3S Profile**   | **Supported Layer Types**                                                                               | **I3S Version**      | **OGC I3S Community Standard Version**          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |------------------|----------------------------- |
| MeshPyramids      | [3D Object](docs/1.6/3Dobject_ReadMe.md) and [Integrated Mesh](docs/1.6/IntegratedMesh_ReadMe.md) | 1.6              | [1.0](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/cs/17-014r5/17-014r5.html)                         |
| Points            | [Point](docs/1.6/Point_ReadMe.md)                                                  | 1.6              | [1.0](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/cs/17-014r5/17-014r5.html)                          |
| PointClouds       | [Point Cloud](docs/2.0/pcsl_ReadMe.md)                                                               | 2.0              | 1.1 (under adoption process) |

A small number of optional changes for the Mesh Pyramids profile (3D Objects and Integrated Mesh Scene Layers), as detailed [here](#version-16), were made to the I3S 1.6 community specification after its adoption as the OGC I3S 1.0 Community Standard. These changes are in the process of being picked up for the OGC Community Standard 1.1 update.

The Point Cloud Scene Layer specification is going through the adoption process for inclusion in OGC I3S 1.1. Through this process, new layer types could be added to I3S Standard.

The following changes to the I3S community specification are yet to be proposed for incorporation into the OGC I3S Community Standard:

- The performance optimizations for the MeshPyramids profile that are part of the I3S 1.7 community specification.
- Inclusion of the [Building Scene Layer](docs/1.6/BSL_ReadMe.md), first introduced at I3S 1.6.
