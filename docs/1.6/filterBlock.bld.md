# Filter Block

A filter block defines what elements will be filtered with a specific filter mode.  To ensure performance on client applications, it is not recommended to declare multiple filter blocks with the same filter mode. Filter blocks are contained in a filter for a building scene layer. Each filter includes at least one filter block.
