# GeometryReferenceParams

Instead of owning a Geometry exclusively, a Feature can reference part of a Geometry defined for the node. This allows to pre-aggregate Geometries for many features. In this case, GeometryReferenceParams must be used.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **href** | string | In-document absolute reference to full geometry definition (Embedded or ArrayBufferView) using the I3S json pointer syntax. For example /geometryData/1 |
| type | string | The type denotes whether the following geometry is defined by using array buffer views (ArrayBufferView), as an internal reference (GeometryReference), as a reference to a shared Resource (SharedResourceReference) or embedded (Embedded). |
| faceRange | number[] | Inclusive range of faces in this geometry that belongs to this feature. |
| lodGeometry | boolean | True if this geometry participates in an LoD tree. Always true in mesh-pyramids profile. |

*Note: properties in **bold** are required*
